                        After creating section and subsections, you can start uploading your documents. You can organize your documents by clicking the  <i class="fa fa-upload"></i>  on the specific section where you want the file to be uploaded.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/upload_file.png')}}" />
                    <p>
                        After clicking the upload button, you will be shown a file uploader.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/uploader.png')}}" />
                    <p>
                        There are two ways in which you can upload your documents:
                    </p>
                    <ol style="color: #636363">
                        <li>Clicking the <strong><i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add files...</strong> button and browsing through your files.</li>
                        <li>Dragging files to the drop area.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These file uploader support multiple file uploads so you can highlight several files or drag multiple files for simultaneous upload.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After selecting your files, you will be able to view them via the preview. At this state, you can still add additional files. You can also remove files from the list by clicking the <strong><i class="fa fa-ban"></i> Cancel</strong> button.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/multi_selected.png')}}" />
                    <p>
                        If you are satisfied with your file selection, you can start uploading simultaneously by clicking the <strong><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Start Upload</strong> or you can upload them individually by clicking <strong><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Start</strong> button next the file thumbnail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also cancel the upload proces by clicking the <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/uploading.png')}}" />
                    <p>
                        After the upload process has finished, you will then be able to see the files inside the subsection where you uploaded it. You can also view a preview by hovering your mouse to the file name.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/file_preview.png')}}" />
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h4 class="panel-title">

                    <p>
                        If you no longer need documents in your library, you can always delete them. There are two ways you can delete the files.
                    </p>
                    <ol style="color: #636363">
                        <li>Click the <strong><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Remove</strong> button beside the file you want to delete</li>
                        <li>Selecting multiple files using the checkbox and clicking <strong><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Delete Selected</strong> button to bulk delete the selected files</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/delete.png')}}" />
                    <p>
                        One advantage of using the bulk delete is you can delete files across sections at once.
                    </p>
                    <img class="thumbnail" src="{{url('/public/img/help_and_settings/document_library/multi_delete.png')}}" />
